<p>
    This is Jack. He's an odd little boy that just got an empty box for his birthday. He may look happy, but he's a
    little disappointed. Now he'll have to put a few things in the box.
</p>

<p>
    Jack would really like...
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Roller blades</li>
    <li>Magic tricks</li>
    <li>Anything Pokemon</li>
    <li>A motorized Lego set</li>
</ul>
<p>
    You can get all this (and more) at an online toy store. Two very popular ones are <a href="toysrus.com">toysrus.com</a> and <a href="eToys.com">eToys</a> .
